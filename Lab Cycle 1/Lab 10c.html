		<p>This is an example of CSS inheritance and specificity.</p>
		<p>In this example, the body element has a font-family of Arial and a color of #333. This applies to all elements within the body, unless overridden by a more specific selector.</p>
		<p>The h1 element has a color of #ff0000 and a font-size of 36px. When the h1 element has the class "special", it also gets a color of #00ff00 and a font-weight of bold. This overrides the previous color and applies only to h1 elements with the class "special".</p>
